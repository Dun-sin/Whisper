## Guidelines

### Issues guidelines

- Don't work on anything unless you are assigned, if you make a pull request without being assigned to that issue, it will be closed without being merged
- Don't work on more than one issue at a time, this is so that you don't make a huge pull request and others can have opportunities to work on another issue while you work on something else

### Pull Request guidelines

- Don't create a pull request on an issue that doesn't exist, create an issue first and if the changes you are proposing are said to be okay, you can go ahead and create a pull request
- Don't work on the main branch, create your own branch by following the instructions [here](#-how-to-make-a-pull-request)
- If you are working on the backend, share a screenrecording of your working software
- don't create a PR for things outside of your issue's scope, it will lead to more work for the maintainers

### General guidelines

- Do read the `readme.md` file
- If there's no PR for an issue in the allocated time, you will be unassigned, the following labels determine the time. `2days`, `4days`, `7 days(1week)`, `2 weeks`

#### 👌🏾 How to fill a pull request template(Text)

- Your Pull Request title should be like a commit message which should look like this -> `[prefix]: [what you did]`
[how to write what you did](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/)
[how to pick which prefix to use](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Conventional_Commits.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index)

- Your PR description should have either `fixes`, `closes` with the issue number you worked on, for example, `fixes #123` or `closes #123` where #123 is the issue you worked on. It should not be `fixes issue #123`
- Your PR description should also have the changes you did e.g added a new component, added a new image.
