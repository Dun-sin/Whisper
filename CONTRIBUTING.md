## Rules

- Don't create a pull request on an issue that doesn't exist, create an issue first and if the changes you are proposing are said to be okay, you can go ahead and create a pull request

- Don't work on anything unless you are assigned, if you make a pull request without being assigned to that issue, it will be closed without being merged

- Don't work on more than one issue at a time, this is so that you don't make a huge pull request and others can have opportunities to work on another issue while you work on something else

- Do read the `readme.md` file

- Fill out issue and pull request(PR) templates properly, if you don't know how, check out previous issues/PR to know how they are filled or this video👇🏾
