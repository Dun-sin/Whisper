## Guidelines

### Issues guidelines

- Don't work on anything unless you are assigned, if you make a pull request without being assigned to that issue, it will be closed without being merged
- Don't work on more than one issue at a time, this is so that you don't make a huge pull request and others can have opportunities to work on another issue while you work on something else

### Pull Request guidelines

- Don't create a pull request on an issue that doesn't exist, create an issue first and if the changes you are proposing are said to be okay, you can go ahead and create a pull request
- Don't work on the main branch, create your own branch by following the instructions [here](#-how-to-make-a-pull-request)
- If you are working on the backend, share a screenrecording of your working software
- don't create a PR for things outside of your issue's scope, it will lead to more work for the maintainers
- don't commit package.json unless you are installing a package

### General guidelines

- Do read the `readme.md` file
- If there's no PR for an issue in the allocated time, you will be unassigned, the following labels determine the time. `easy: 4days`, `medium: 7 days(1week)`, `hard: 2 weeks`
- Fill out issue and pull request(PR) templates properly, if you don't know how, check out previous issues/PR to know how they are filled, this video👇🏾 or [this](#-how-to-fill-a-pull-request-templatetext)

#### 👌🏾 How to fill a pull request template(Text)

- Your PR title should be according to the conventional commit standards([link](https://gist.github.com/Zekfad/f51cb06ac76e2457f11c80ed705c95a3)) for example, if the added something new to the project(doesn't matter how small), your PR title should be like this -> `feat: added a text` <- Whatever you added. If you fixed something then your PR title should be like this -> `fix: wrong link` <- whatever you fixed
- Your PR description should have either `fixes`, `closes` with the issue number you worked on, for example, `fixes #123` or `closes #123` where #123 is the issue you worked on. It should not be `fixes issue #123`
- Your PR description should also have the changes you did e.g added a new component, added a new image.
