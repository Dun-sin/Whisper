            ## Protected Branch
            In order to be considered for merging, the pull request changes must
            not be implemented on the "%branch%" branch. This is described in our
            [Contributing Guide](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/getting-started/).
            We would suggest that you close this PR and implement your changes as
            described in our Contributing Guide and open a new pull request.

              In order to be considered for merging, the pull request title must match the specification in 
              [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). You can edit
              the title in order for this check to pass.
              Most often, our PR titles are something like one of these:
                - docs: correct typo in README
                - feat: implement dark mode"
                - fix: correct remove button behavior
