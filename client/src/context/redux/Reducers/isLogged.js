import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

/**
 * Changed the state from a boolean type to an object. This helps improve
 * security and user identification for each login.
 * Each property of the state is explained in detail below.
 *
 *
 * isLoggedIn:  Self explanatory (Tells whether user is currently logged in or
 *              not)
 *
 *  loginType:  Accepted values: (anonymous, email). Tells whether user logged
 *              in anonymously or via email
 *
 *    loginId:  A string containing a token generated after a successful login.
 *              Added as a security measure to prevent any user from viewing
 *              other users' messages.
 *              This is because by using only email (previous solution) to
 *              identify users, any user can view other users' messages by
 *              setting localStorage.auth.email property to their target's email
 *
 *      email:  Email for the logged in user (email logins only). Would be null
 *              for anonymous users
